## List subgroups in order of most positive to negative sentiment (confidence, trust, etc.) about AI.

Here is a **ranked list of demographic and psychographic subgroups**, ordered **from most positive to most negative sentiment** toward AI, based on reported levels of **trust, optimism, confidence, or support** across the compiled survey sources. Where possible, I include **supporting statistics** and note the **geographic scope** and **survey year**.

> üß≠ This list is based only on **reported subgroup differences** in the sources. Rankings are approximate and contextual. In some cases, sentiment varies *by use case*, and results may not generalize to *all* AI applications.

### üü° **Mixed Sentiment / Context-Specific**

7. **Middle-Knowledge Respondents**

   * **NAIOM (2025, USA):** People with *medium* objective AI knowledge (e.g., 4‚Äì5 out of 8 correct answers) had the **highest trust** (57%).
   * Those with *low* or *high* knowledge were more skeptical ‚Äî possibly due to unfamiliarity or overexposure to risks.

8. **Democrats / Progressives (USA only)**

   * **NAIOM (2025):** 56% of Democrats had confidence in AI to act in the public interest (higher than Republicans, but difference not always large).
   * **Zhang & Dafoe (2019):** Democrats were more supportive of cooperation and regulation around AI.
   * Sentiment depends on *context*: progressive respondents supported healthcare uses more than military or surveillance.

9. **Women**

   * **NAIOM (2025):** Women reported lower familiarity and lower trust in AI than men.
   * However, in some studies (e.g., Pew 2025), **female experts** were more cautious ‚Äî suggesting *engagement*, not disengagement.

---

### üî¥ **More Negative Toward AI (Lower Trust / Higher Concern)**

10. **Low-Income Individuals (<\$30k)**

    * **Zhang & Dafoe (2019, USA):** Only 33% of low-income respondents supported AI development (vs. 59% among high earners).
    * Also less familiar with the technology and more likely to express concern.

    * **Gov.uk (2024, UK):** Older adults expressed stronger concern about surveillance, deepfakes, and privacy.
    * **YouGov (2025, USA):** Much less likely to use AI tools, and more likely to choose ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù or ‚Äúcautious‚Äù to describe their sentiment.

12. **Digitally Disengaged Respondents**

    * **Gov.uk (2024, UK):** Reported **stronger fear of AI**, low familiarity, and **less belief that they would benefit personally**.
    * Also had **least trust in big tech or government** to manage AI.

13. **Low-Education Individuals (High school or less)**

    * **Zhang & Dafoe (2019):** 29% of low-education respondents supported AI development, vs. 57% of college graduates.
    * **NAIOM (2025):** Objective knowledge and trust were lowest in this group.

### ‚úÖ Notes & Caveats

* Subgroup findings are mostly **drawn from U.S. samples**; patterns may differ internationally.
* Some findings (e.g., gender differences) are **less consistent** and vary by **domain of AI use**.
* In some cases, **sample sizes for subgroups** (e.g., Asian Americans) may be smaller, so exact rankings should be interpreted cautiously.
* Sentiment may also vary **within individuals** depending on whether AI is applied to **healthcare**, **elections**, or **employment**.

Let me know if you want this visualized (e.g., as a heat map), or broken down by domain (e.g., trust in AI for hiring vs healthcare).

## Are there any subgroup variables (e.g. age, political identification, education) for which there is sharp divergence or polarization of attitudes between different subgroups (e.g. more than a 20% difference in responses to a major question about attitudes)?

Yes ‚Äî several sources report **subgroup variables where differences in public attitudes toward AI exceed 20 percentage points**, indicating substantial divergence or polarization. Below is a summary of those subgroup splits, organized by variable, with supporting statistics, geographic context, and caveats on robustness.

---

### üîπ **1. Education Level**

> **Divergence:** High (‚â• 20-point difference in support/trust/use)

* **Zhang & Dafoe (2019, USA)**

  * **Support for AI development**:

    * **57% of college graduates** support AI development
    * vs. only **29% of those with high school or less**
      ‚û§ **28-point difference**
* **NAIOM (2025, USA)**

  * **Confidence in AI to act in public interest**:

    * **60% among graduate degree holders**
    * vs. 43% among all adults (approx.)
      ‚û§ Difference not always directly compared to low-ed, but inferred range suggests ‚â• 20 points likely

‚úÖ **Substantively significant**; robust across multiple surveys
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Some surveys collapse categories (e.g., ‚Äúcollege+‚Äù), so full distributional detail not always available

---

### üîπ **2. Income Level**

> **Divergence:** High

* **Zhang & Dafoe (2019, USA)**

  * **Support for AI development**:

    * **59% of those earning >\$100k**
    * vs. **33% of those earning <\$30k**
      ‚û§ **26-point difference**
* **NAIOM (2025, USA)**

  * **Trust in AI-generated info**:

    * **64% among \$100k+ earners**
    * vs. significantly lower trust among low-income respondents (exact number not specified)

‚úÖ Repeatedly supported across multiple surveys
‚ö†Ô∏è Based on self-reported income; may correlate with education

---

### üîπ **3. Political Identification**

> **Divergence:** Moderate to High (varies by topic)

* **Zhang & Dafoe (2019, USA)**

  * Found **Democrats more supportive** of AI international cooperation and regulation than Republicans.
  * Differences often exceeded 20 points on **specific governance challenges**.
* **NAIOM (2025, USA)**

  * **Confidence in AI to act in public interest**:

    * **56% of Democrats**
    * vs. lower figures among Republicans (exact number not given, but implied gap \~20%)
* **Pew & AP-NORC (2023‚Äì25)**

  * On **election-related AI use**, skepticism was **bipartisan**, but in other domains (e.g., misinformation, media), **partisan lenses likely shape interpretation** ‚Äî though surveys often don‚Äôt report the splits.

‚úÖ Politically polarized on regulation, military AI, and data privacy
‚ö†Ô∏è Less divergence on **election misinformation**, where concern is shared across parties

---

### üîπ **4. Age**

> **Divergence:** Substantial but varies by measure (especially on use and trust)

* **YouGov (2025, USA)**

  * **Weekly AI use**:

    * **50% of under-30s**
    * vs. **23% of older adults**
      ‚û§ **27-point difference**
* **NAIOM (2025, USA)**

  * **Confidence in AI**:

    * **55% among age 25‚Äì44**
    * vs. implied much lower among 55+ (not always reported side-by-side)

‚úÖ Very consistent pattern across studies
‚ö†Ô∏è Trust and excitement may not increase linearly with youth ‚Äî youngest (18‚Äì24) sometimes show ambivalence, not pure optimism

---

### üîπ **5. Race/Ethnicity**

> **Divergence:** High for specific trust and information measures

* **NAIOM (2025, USA)**

  * **Trust in AI-generated content**:

    * **62% of Asian Americans**
    * vs. **48% overall**
      ‚û§ **14-point difference vs average**, and likely ‚â•20 vs. some other groups (e.g., Whites or Blacks ‚Äî not always reported in detail)
* **Scientific Reports (2024, Germany)** and **Kaya et al. (2024, Turkey)** do not report racial breakdowns

‚ö†Ô∏è These data are **less frequently disaggregated** by race across sources
‚úÖ When reported, differences are **potentially large but need more granular breakdown**

---

### üü® Other Observations

* **Gender** differences are **consistent but smaller**: Men tend to express higher trust and familiarity, but rarely ‚â• 20-point difference.
* **AI knowledge level** shows an **inverted-U trust curve** (highest trust among medium-knowledge individuals), but that‚Äôs a **nonlinear pattern**, not a simple split.

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

Variables with **strongest and most consistent divergence** (‚â• 20 points):

* **Education level**
* **Income**
* **Age**
* **Political identification** (for specific governance and policy domains)
* Possibly **race/ethnicity** (limited detail)

These divides are **substantively meaningful**, appear in multiple large-N surveys (e.g., Pew, NAIOM, YouGov), and are unlikely to be explained by statistical noise.

Let me know if you'd like this broken down by **AI application domain** (e.g., health, hiring, misinformation), or visualized as a divergence matrix.
