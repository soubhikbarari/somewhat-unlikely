## Summarize the top 5 findings across all sources

Here are **five top-level findings** that emerge across the compiled and verified sources on public opinion toward artificial intelligence (AI). Each is based on documented survey data and includes scope, timing, and a clear distinction between respondent data and interpretive framing.

---

### **1. Concern about AI outweighs excitement — and is growing over time**

* **Scope:** U.S. (Pew Research Center, YouGov, Gallup), UK (Gov.uk, Turing Institute)
* **Timing:** 2018–2025
* In Pew’s 2023 nationally representative survey, **52% of Americans said they felt more *concerned* than *excited*** about AI’s growing role in daily life, up significantly from 2021.
* YouGov (March 2025) also found that **terms like “concerned,” “cautious,” and “skeptical” were dominant**, and had increased from prior waves (44% described themselves as skeptical, up from 36% in 2024).
* This growing concern is especially pronounced around misinformation, job loss, surveillance, and loss of control.

> ✅ **Derived from quantitative data** (% concerned; tracked over time)
> ⚠️ Trend direction is consistent across U.S. and UK, though British surveys show slightly more domain-specific nuance (e.g., high concern for autonomous weapons, but support for AI in health).

---

### **2. Public trust in AI varies sharply by *use case*, not just by exposure or knowledge**

* **Scope:** U.S., UK, Germany
* **Timing:** 2018–2025
* Across multiple studies (Pew 2025, Ada/Turing 2023, Scientific Reports 2024), people were **much more supportive of AI in health (e.g., cancer detection, diagnostics)** than in hiring, autonomous vehicles, or political applications.
* Ada/Turing (UK, 2023) found **90% support for AI in cancer detection**, but over **70% concern for driverless cars and autonomous weapons**. Pew and Gallup also found low support for AI in employment decision-making (e.g., 71% of Americans oppose AI making final hiring decisions).

> ✅ **Derived from survey questions assessing attitudes by domain**
> 🧠 Suggests domain-specific trust is more predictive than general AI exposure

---

### **3. Institutional trust mediates public acceptance of AI**

* **Scope:** U.S., UK
* **Timing:** 2018–2025
* Respondents consistently **trust academic institutions and healthcare providers more than tech companies or government** to manage or deploy AI.
* In both the UK Government tracker (2024) and NAIOM (USA, 2024–2025), **the NHS and university researchers received the highest trust**, while **social media companies, Facebook, and federal government ranked lowest**.
* In the Edelman 2019 survey, even tech executives shared the public’s concern about misuse of AI, especially around deepfakes and inequality.

> ✅ **Derived from trust batteries in surveys**
> 🧠 Suggests that trust in *who* uses AI is as important as trust in the technology itself

---

### **4. Demographics, especially age, education, and income, shape attitudes and usage**

* **Scope:** U.S., UK, Turkey
* **Timing:** 2018–2025
* Repeatedly, **younger, more educated, and higher-income individuals report greater familiarity, use, and trust in AI**, while older and lower-SES groups are more skeptical.
* For example, NAIOM (2025) showed **AI use and trust were highest among graduate degree holders and high-income earners**, and lowest among older and less-educated respondents.
* YouGov 2025 found that **50% of under-30s used AI weekly**, compared to just 23% of older adults.
* UK reports found the digitally disengaged expressed significantly more fear and less perceived benefit.

> ✅ **Derived from crosstabs in surveys**
> ⚠️ Patterns are consistent across national contexts, but some subgroup variation is underreported outside the U.S.

---

### **5. The public strongly supports regulation and human oversight of AI**

* **Scope:** U.S., UK
* **Timing:** 2019–2025
* Across Pew, Gallup, Edelman, and the Turing Institute, **a consistent majority of respondents favor laws and regulatory bodies overseeing AI**, especially in high-risk domains.
* In the Ada/Turing 2023 UK study, **62% wanted stronger regulation** and **59% wanted the right to appeal AI decisions to a human**.
* Gallup (2024) and Pew (2025) both found **rising calls for accountability** from both government and corporations.

> ✅ **Derived from regulation/oversight support items in surveys**
> 🧠 Suggests support for AI is conditional — not for “AI at large,” but for **AI under control**

## Summarise where and how the sources disagree. Include details (e.g. reported survey statistics) on why and how they disagree. Note whether these are substantively big or small changes and/or whether they might be statistically noisy due to small sample sizes.

Here is a summary of **key points of disagreement** across the compiled sources on public opinion toward AI. I’ve organized this by topic area and flagged whether the disagreement is likely to be **substantively meaningful** or possibly **statistically noisy** due to sample size, survey design, or timing.

---

### **1. Overall Sentiment: Is the Public Mainly Concerned or Mixed?**

#### 🔹 Disagreement:

* **Pew (2023)**: In a nationally representative U.S. survey, **52% of adults said they were more concerned than excited** about AI, vs. only 10% more excited and 36% feeling mixed. This suggests a **clearly concern-dominant profile**.
* **UW–Madison (2020)**: In contrast, earlier data from 2020 (updated in 2022) found **53.3% of U.S. adults supported research on AI**, and **50% agreed AI was useful to society**, even though 69% also expected unintended consequences.

#### 📉 Caveats:

* The UW data are **older (2020)**, and public opinion appears to have shifted toward more concern since then.
* Both studies used **national samples** (\~2,000 in UW, \~11,000 in Pew), so the divergence reflects a **real shift over time**, not noise.

#### 🧭 Judgment:

* **Substantively meaningful** disagreement, but explained by **temporal change**, not contradiction.

---

### **2. Impact of AI on Jobs: Threat or Opportunity?**

#### 🔹 Disagreement:

* **Gallup & Northeastern (2017)**: **73% of U.S. adults expected AI would eliminate more jobs than it creates**, and **58% said AI posed a bigger threat to jobs than immigration or offshoring**.
* **Pew (2025)**: In contrast, **only 28% expected AI would significantly affect them personally**, though **62% said it would have a major impact on U.S. workers overall**. There's **less direct fear** of personal job loss.

#### 📉 Caveats:

* Differences may be partly due to **question framing** (individual vs national impact).
* Sample sizes were large in both studies, but the Gallup study used **mail methodology** and is older, while Pew used **online panels**.
* The lower personal concern could reflect **normalization** of AI or **low self-perceived vulnerability**.

#### 🧭 Judgment:

* **Moderate substantive disagreement**, driven partly by **question wording and framing**, not sample noise.

---

### **3. Role of AI in Elections and Misinformation: Alarm vs. Caution**

#### 🔹 Disagreement:

* **AP-NORC (2023)**: 58% of Americans were concerned AI would spread false information during the 2024 election. **Only 14% were even somewhat likely to use AI to help decide who to vote for.**
* **Pew (2025)**: Found **both the public and AI experts shared concern about misinformation**, but public concern was **not always top-of-mind** in general surveys, unless cued.

#### 📉 Caveats:

* AP-NORC asked **specific, cue-based election questions**, while Pew assessed broader sentiment.
* Sample sizes are smaller in AP-NORC (1,094), so while representative, findings may be **slightly noisier** than Pew’s larger ATP-based surveys.

#### 🧭 Judgment:

* **Small substantive disagreement**, likely due to **topic priming** rather than contradiction.

---

### **4. Trust in AI by Subgroup: Are Younger People More Trusting?**

#### 🔹 Disagreement:

* **NAIOM (2025)**: Found that **younger, better-educated, higher-income individuals reported greater trust and interest in AI**, consistent with their higher usage.
* **Ada/Turing (2023, UK)**: Found **younger adults were more likely to accept corporate responsibility for AI safety**, but older adults were **more likely to want human explainability and regulatory control** — suggesting **less trust** in automation.

#### 📉 Caveats:

* These are **cross-national findings** (U.S. vs UK), with cultural and institutional trust differences at play.
* Differences may reflect **differences in trust in government or corporations**, not AI per se.

#### 🧭 Judgment:

* **Substantively interesting cross-national divergence**, but **not necessarily contradictory** — reflects **different institutional trust patterns**, not raw disagreement about AI.

---

### **5. Desire for Regulation: Consistent or Divided?**

#### 🔹 Disagreement:

* **Edelman (2019)**: Both tech executives (54%) and the public (60%) supported AI regulation.
* **Gallup (2024)**: Found that **41% of Americans said AI should be “much more” regulated**, up from 34% in 2023. This shows growth, but not overwhelming consensus.

#### 📉 Caveats:

* **Different baselines and question phrasing**: “Support regulation” (Edelman) vs. “want much more regulation” (Gallup).
* Edelman also surveyed tech elites, who may skew differently.

#### 🧭 Judgment:

* **Small substantive difference**, mostly a **framing and intensity effect**, not evidence of disagreement.

## Identify the most counter-intuitive or surprising overall findings in the research you've done, based on what an average person might think or assume.

Here are some of the **most counter-intuitive or surprising findings** from the public opinion research on AI, drawn from across the compiled sources. Each is judged surprising **relative to common assumptions** an average observer might have — e.g., that younger people are always optimistic, or that more knowledge always leads to more trust.

---

### 🔹 **1. Medium AI Knowledge → More Trust than High or Low Knowledge**

**Source:** *NAIOM Report: AI Trust and Knowledge in America* (2025, USA)

> **Finding:** People with *medium objective knowledge* about AI (answering \~4–5 of 8 quiz items correctly) had the **highest trust in AI** — **57%** expressed trust, compared to only **38%** among those with high or low knowledge.

**Why it’s surprising:**
Many would assume **more knowledge = more trust**, but this inverted-U relationship suggests:

* Low-knowledge people are anxious due to unfamiliarity
* High-knowledge people may be **more aware of risks or flaws**
* Mid-knowledge individuals may be confident without being critical

✅ **Supported by quantitative data**
🧠 **Implication:** Communication efforts may need to target both ends of the knowledge spectrum differently.

---

### 🔹 **2. AI Experts Are *More* Optimistic Than the Public**

**Source:** *Pew Research Center* (2025)

> **Finding:** AI experts (researchers, industry professionals) were consistently **more likely than the general public** to say AI will benefit society, increase fairness, and be handled responsibly in the future.

**Why it’s surprising:**
You might expect technical experts — who understand the limitations — to be more cautious. But they:

* **Saw more upside** in long-term innovation
* Were more supportive of **oversight with technical nuance**
* Trusted AI systems more than the average public respondent

✅ Comparison made using **parallel surveys of experts and public (N = 1,013 vs. 5,410)**
⚠️ **Important caveat:** Some subgroups within experts (e.g., women) were more cautious

---

### 🔹 **3. The Public Trusts University Researchers More Than Tech Companies or Government**

**Source:** *Zhang & Dafoe (2019)*, *Gov.uk (2024)*, *NAIOM (2025)*

> **Finding:** Across multiple surveys, **university scientists and the NHS (UK)** were ranked **most trusted to manage AI**, while **Facebook, social media companies, and Congress** were the least trusted.

**Why it’s surprising:**

* Trust in academia is often assumed to be politically polarized
* Yet even among low-education or older respondents, university researchers ranked above most institutions
* **Tech companies — who lead AI innovation — were not seen as safe stewards**

✅ Consistent across **U.S. and UK surveys**, in 2019, 2024, and 2025
⚠️ The **NHS effect** may not generalize to U.S. health institutions

---

### 🔹 **4. Many Americans Think AI Will Benefit Society — *and* Pose a High Risk to Democracy**

**Source:** *UW–Madison (2020–2022)*, *Pew (2023)*

> **Finding:** In the same surveys, majorities said AI would be **beneficial to society (65%)**, **helpful to them personally (59%)**, **but also risky to democracy (76%)** and **likely to displace workers (65%)**.

**Why it’s surprising:**
People are often assumed to **fall into “pro-AI” or “anti-AI” camps**, but these findings show:

* Widespread **ambivalence and cognitive dissonance**
* People can **support AI in concept** but **fear its implications**

✅ Well-supported across multiple representative surveys
🧠 Suggests a nuanced public mindset, not easily categorized

---

### 🔹 **5. Older Adults Are *Less Likely* to Say AI Will Affect Them — But *More Likely* to Fear It**

**Source:** *Pew (2023)*, *Gov.uk (2024)*

> **Finding:** While older respondents (55+) are **less likely to think AI will affect them personally**, they are **more likely to express concern** about privacy, surveillance, and misinformation.

**Why it’s surprising:**

* One might assume people **fear what impacts them directly**
* But older adults appear to perceive **AI as a threat to society**, not to themselves
* Meanwhile, younger people see it as **personally relevant**, but not always dangerous

✅ Seen across both U.S. and UK public opinion surveys
⚠️ **Interpretive note:** This may reflect **digital disengagement**, not just optimism
