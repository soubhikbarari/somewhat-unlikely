## Accounting for the time period that each study took place, summarize the top 5 ways that opinions about AI have changed. Include details (e.g. reported survey statistics) and note whether these are substantively big or small changes and/or whether they might be statistically noisy due to small sample sizes. 

Based on the compiled longitudinal studies (primarily U.S.-based) and accounting for **differences in time period, methodology, and sample size**, here are the **top 5 changes in public opinion about AI from \~2018 to 2025**, ranked by **substantive significance** and **robustness of evidence**.

---

### **1. Concern about AI has increased faster than excitement**

* **Change Over Time:**

  * **Pew (2018):** AI was broadly seen as promising but unfamiliar ‚Äî most respondents expressed **neutral or cautious optimism**.
  * **Pew (2023):** A clear shift occurred: **52% of Americans said they were more concerned than excited** about AI‚Äôs growing role, up from **38% in 2022**.
  * **YouGov (2025):** The share describing themselves as **‚Äúskeptical‚Äù increased to 44%**, up from 36% in 2024.
  * **Gallup & Telescope (2024):** Found **63% of Americans expressed concern** about AI, with **only 24% expressing optimism**.

* **Substantive Shift?** ‚úÖ **Yes ‚Äî large and consistent across sources**

* **Statistical Confidence?** ‚úÖ Strong: multiple nationally representative samples (Pew \~11,000; Gallup \~4,000)

---

### **2. Public awareness and personal use of AI tools has surged**

* **Change Over Time:**

  * **Edelman (2019):** Most respondents had limited awareness of AI beyond science fiction or broad automation.
  * **Zhang & Dafoe (2018):** Only **41% supported AI development**, with relatively low direct experience.
  * **NAIOM (2024):** **53% of Americans had used a generative AI tool**, and **37% had used ChatGPT**; **63% had heard of it**.
  * **YouGov (2025):** Weekly use of generative AI tools jumped from **28% in early 2024** to **39% by early 2025**.

* **Substantive Shift?** ‚úÖ **Yes ‚Äî large jump in adoption and recognition**

* **Statistical Confidence?** ‚úÖ Strong, based on clear growth in repeated measures

---

### **3. Support for regulation and human oversight has strengthened**

* **Change Over Time:**

  * **Edelman (2019):** 60% of Americans and 54% of tech executives supported stronger AI regulation.
  * **Turing Institute (2023):** **62% of UK adults** wanted new laws to govern AI.
  * **Pew (2025):** Found growing public support for requiring **‚Äúhuman explainability‚Äù and government oversight**, especially in high-risk domains like hiring or elections.

* **Substantive Shift?** ‚úÖ **Yes ‚Äî sustained and cross-national**

* **Statistical Confidence?** ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate to strong, though **regulatory support intensity varies** depending on question wording and application domain

---

### **4. Perceived personal impact of AI remains low, despite growing use**

* **Change Over Time:**

  * **Gallup & Northeastern (2017):** 73% expected AI would eliminate more jobs than it creates.
  * **Pew (2025):** While **62% said AI would impact U.S. workers**, only **28% believed it would affect them personally**.
  * This **gap between general concern and personal concern** has widened, even as tools like ChatGPT become embedded in everyday work and communication.

* **Substantive Shift?** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mixed ‚Äî stable personal detachment despite rising usage**

* **Statistical Confidence?** ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate ‚Äî longitudinal questions about personal impact are less common, and trends depend on framing

---

### **5. Institutional trust has become more polarized**

* **Change Over Time:**

  * **Zhang & Dafoe (2019):** University researchers (50%) and the U.S. military (49%) received the highest trust to manage AI; tech companies were trusted far less.
  * **NAIOM (2025):** **Only 48% of Americans trusted AI-generated info**, but this varied **sharply by subgroup** (e.g., **64% trust among high-income and graduate-educated**, vs. <40% among low-income, low-ed).
  * **Gov.uk (2024):** The **NHS and universities remained most trusted**; **social media companies and government** remained the least.

* **Substantive Shift?** ‚úÖ **Yes ‚Äî rising divergence in institutional trust**

* **Statistical Confidence?** ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed ‚Äî strong for **ranking of institutions**, weaker for **trend data**, as fewer sources report exact year-to-year movement

Let me know if you'd like to generate **domain-specific trends** (e.g., AI in healthcare, hiring, elections), or visualize these shifts on a timeline.

## Make some conclusions about domain-specific trends. What domain was of most concern/optimism in the earliest studies vs. the later studies? (Do note how confident you are about these conclusions)

Here‚Äôs a summary of **domain-specific trends** in public attitudes toward AI over time, focusing on **which domains attracted the most concern or optimism** in earlier studies (2017‚Äì2019) vs. more recent ones (2023‚Äì2025).
