# Prompt: Deep Research on Public Opinion Toward Artificial Intelligence

I'm compiling a comprehensive overview of the **state of public opinion on artificial intelligence (AI)**. Please perform a **deep research scan** of **major polling sources, survey reports, and published studies** on this topic from **2010 to the present**, and create two outputs:

---

## Part 1: Narrative Report (Synthesis)

For each relevant source you find (or I upload/share), provide a **concise but rigorous narrative synthesis** that includes:

* **Bolded heading** with the following:
  **Source organization, authors (if available), publication year, and geographic context** (e.g., “USA,” “UK,” “Global,” “Turkey,” etc.)

* In the body:

  * **Describe the survey method** (e.g., online poll, probability-based panel, representative sample, etc.)
  * **Specify when the data was collected**
  * **Summarize the key findings** on public attitudes toward AI (e.g., awareness, concern, optimism, perceived risks, policy preferences)
  * **Identify patterns across subgroups** (e.g., age, education, ideology, income, race/ethnicity, etc.)
  * **Highlight trends or shifts** over time, if possible

Make sure your synthesis clearly distinguishes **what was asked, when**, and **how respondents felt** about AI in different domains (e.g., employment, misinformation, healthcare, governance, surveillance, etc.).

## Part 2: Metadata Table

Create a structured **markdown-style table** summarizing each source, with the following columns:

\| Source/Organization/Journal | Authors | Title for Report | Context | Date Range survey(s) conducted | Sample size of survey | Types of attitude questions | Subgroups examined |

Fill in each row based on what the source provides or what you infer through careful reading.

---

## Additional Notes:

* If I upload **PDFs or specific URLs**, incorporate them into the synthesis and table.
* If certain findings are especially **nuanced**, **demographically split**, or **longitudinal**, please make that clear.
* I may ask follow-up questions about:

  * Changes over time
  * International comparisons
  * Demographic divides (e.g., AI anxiety among younger users vs older non-users)
  * Institutional trust or misinformation-related concerns
  * Differences across domains (e.g., AI in health vs in elections)

---

You may begin with a foundational scan of trusted sources like:

* Pew Research Center
* Axios
* NORC / AP-NORC
* Gallup
* YouGov
* Edelman Trust Barometer
* UK Government & Ada Lovelace Institute
* Academic journals (e.g., *Public Opinion Quarterly*, *American Journal of Political Science*, *Scientific Reports*, *Nature Human Behaviour*)

---

## Goal:

To create a **clear, research-grounded narrative and structured reference table** that summarizes what is known about **public opinion on AI**, suitable for a policy report, blog post, or academic project.
